Here’s a structured plan for a lesson that introduces JavaScript objects and their associated methods.

---

### **Lesson Plan: Introduction to Objects and Object Methods**

#### **1. Introduction to Objects**
Start by explaining what an object is in JavaScript:
- **Definition**: An object is a collection of key-value pairs (properties). These keys can be strings or symbols, while the values can be any type of data, including other objects, arrays, or functions.
  
Example:
```js
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  isStudent: true,
};
```

**Key Points**:
- Properties in objects are mutable.
- Properties are accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.

#### **2. Creating and Accessing Objects**
- **Dot Notation**:
  ```js
  console.log(person.name); // 'John'
  ```
- **Bracket Notation**:
  ```js
  console.log(person['age']); // 30
  ```

#### **3. Adding, Updating, and Deleting Properties**
- **Adding a property**:
  ```js
  person.hobbies = ['reading', 'swimming'];
  ```
- **Updating a property**:
  ```js
  person.age = 31;
  ```
- **Deleting a property**:
  ```js
  delete person.isStudent;
  ```

#### **4. Methods within Objects**
Objects can have methods, which are functions assigned to properties.
Example:
```js
const car = {
  brand: 'Toyota',
  speed: 120,
  drive() {
    console.log('Driving at ' + this.speed + ' km/h');
  }
};

car.drive(); // 'Driving at 120 km/h'
```
**Explain the use of `this`** keyword to refer to the object within its methods.

### **5. Key Object Methods and Built-in Methods**
Introduce key methods for object manipulation.

- **Object.keys()**: Returns an array of property names.
  ```js
  const keys = Object.keys(person); // ['name', 'age', 'hobbies']
  ```

- **Object.values()**: Returns an array of property values.
  ```js
  const values = Object.values(person); // ['John', 31, ['reading', 'swimming']]
  ```

- **Object.entries()**: Returns an array of key-value pairs.
  ```js
  const entries = Object.entries(person);
  // [['name', 'John'], ['age', 31], ['hobbies', ['reading', 'swimming']]]
  ```

- **Object.assign()**: Copies values from one or more source objects to a target object.
  ```js
  const newPerson = Object.assign({}, person, { city: 'New York' });
  ```

- **Object.freeze()**: Freezes an object, preventing new properties from being added, existing properties from being removed, and values from being changed.
  ```js
  Object.freeze(person);
  person.name = 'Jane'; // Won’t change
  ```

- **Object.seal()**: Seals an object, preventing new properties from being added, though existing properties can still be modified.
  ```js
  Object.seal(person);
  person.age = 32; // Allowed
  delete person.name; // Won't be deleted
  ```

### **6. Practical Exercise Examples**

#### **Exercise 1: Create an Object**
- Ask students to create an object representing a book, with properties like title, author, and number of pages. Add a method to print book details using `this`.

#### **Exercise 2: Object Methods Practice**
- Have students create a user profile object with keys `name`, `email`, and `age`. Use `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` to log these details.

#### **Exercise 3: Shallow Copy**
- Ask students to use `Object.assign()` to clone an object and modify a property in the clone without affecting the original object.

#### **Exercise 4: Freezing an Object**
- Challenge students to freeze an object and demonstrate that further changes to the object are not applied.

### **7. Advanced Object Topics (Optional for Intermediate Students)**

- **Prototypes**: Introduce the concept of prototype chains and inheritance.
- **Constructor Functions and Classes**: Explain how to create objects using constructor functions and ES6 classes.

### **8. Conclusion and Q&A**
Wrap up the session by reviewing the most important methods discussed and allowing time for questions.

This structure will help your students gain a solid understanding of objects and how to work with them in JavaScript!
